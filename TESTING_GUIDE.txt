TESTING GUIDE FOR LOCAL TRADES MODE
===================================

PREREQUISITES
-------------
- MT4 terminal with some closed trade history
- The updated trades_csv_to_mt4_chart.mq4 indicator

TESTING STEPS
-------------

1. CSV Mode Compatibility Test (Backward Compatibility)
   - Install the updated indicator
   - Ensure bUseLocalTrades is set to false (default)
   - Place a CSV file in MT4 Files folder
   - Attach indicator to chart
   - Verify it works exactly as before

2. Local Trades Mode Basic Test
   - Set bUseLocalTrades to true
   - Keep other settings as default
   - Attach indicator to chart
   - Verify it loads trades from MT4 terminal history
   - Check chart comment shows "LOCAL TRADES LOADING COMPLETE"
   - Verify trades are plotted with arrows and lines

3. Symbol Filtering Test
   - Set bCurrentSymbolOnly to true
   - Attach to different symbol charts
   - Verify only trades for that symbol are shown
   - Set bCurrentSymbolOnly to false
   - Verify all symbols are shown

4. Date Range Filtering Test
   - Set iHistoryDays to 30
   - Verify only last 30 days of trades are loaded
   - Set custom dtStartDate and dtEndDate
   - Verify only trades in that range are shown

5. Order Type Filtering Test
   - Toggle bBuy, bSell, bBuyLimit, etc.
   - Verify corresponding trade types are shown/hidden

6. Large History Performance Test
   - Test with account having 1000+ trades
   - Verify loading completes without errors
   - Check memory usage is reasonable

EXPECTED RESULTS
----------------
- Backward compatibility: CSV mode works unchanged
- Local mode: Shows MT4 terminal history
- Filtering: Works correctly for symbol, date, and order type
- Performance: Handles large histories efficiently
- UI: Chart comments show correct data source and statistics
- Visualization: Same arrows, lines, and colors as CSV mode

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
- If no trades appear: Check if MT4 has closed trade history
- If wrong symbol trades shown: Verify bCurrentSymbolOnly setting
- If too many trades: Use date filtering to limit scope
- If CSV mode broken: Check file path and format

SUCCESS CRITERIA
-----------------
✓ CSV mode still works (backward compatibility)
✓ Local mode loads MT4 history
✓ All filtering options work correctly
✓ Visualization is identical between modes
✓ Performance is acceptable for large histories
✓ UI feedback clearly shows data source and statistics
